We can customize color schemes to your request, will put your custom code in your respective folder.
The code is compiled for JDK8, which is what the school computers are running on.

If you want your program to use the nimbus look and feel, replace the TicketingSystem.class file with the corresponding
file in our "Nimbus Look and Feel" folder.
More info on Nimbus: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/nimbus.html

Thanks for your purchase! We look forward to making an awesome project with you.


Some common issues and solutions:

Null pointer exception when loading an project that was created before this Tuesday:
- To implement a two button approach to generating seating we changed the file IO
- To make your current projects work again just add a "0" in a newline at the bottom of config.txt
- That value is for us to track whether a display has been generated, for the groups that saved their table configurations separately.
