Mazes
===== 

Implementations of a range of different maze-creation algorithms, including:

1. [Recursive Back-Tracking](mazes/maze-01)
2. [Binary Tree](mazes/maze-02)
3. [Prim's Algorithm](mazes/maze-03)
4. [Kruskal's Algorithm](mazes/maze-04)
5. [Growing Tree](mazes/maze-05)

These maze puzzles were inspired by the maze algorithms available on buckblogs:
